  #       I have involved in research environment and AI since my first summer of undergraduate study where I had a chance to have an intership with NECTEC. My first project was to create an MLP for mmWave beam and blockage prediction utilizing Sub-6 GHz signals under the supervision of Dr. Paramin Sangwongnam.

  #       In my second interhsip, I researched on multi-object detection for autonomous driving leading to the project underreview Image and Vision Computing journal  (SJR: Q1, Cite Score: 7.1, Impact Factor: 5.2) under the supervision of Dr. Paramin Sangwongnam and Assoc. Prof. Dr.Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut.

  #       I also had the opportunity to collaborate with

  #       Use this area to speak to your mission. I'm a research scientist in the Moonshot team at DeepMind. I blog about machine learning, deep learning, and moonshots.

  #       I apply a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to comprehensively investigate the role of science and technology in the economy.
